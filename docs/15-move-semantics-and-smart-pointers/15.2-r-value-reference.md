<!-- Way back in chapter 1, we mentioned l-values and r-values, and then told you not to worry that much about them. That was fair advice prior to C++11. But understanding move semantics in C++11 requires a re-examination of the topic. So let’s do that now. -->

回到[第一章]()我们讨论了左值和右值，然后告诉你不要太担心他们。在 `C++11` 之前，这是一个公平的建议。但是理解 `C++11` 中的移动语义需要对这个主题进行重新学习。所以现在就开始吧。

## 左值和右值
<!-- L-values and r-values -->

<!-- Despite having the word “value” in their names, l-values and r-values are actually not properties of values, but rather, properties of expressions. -->

尽管名称中有 **“值”** 一词，但 **左值** 和 **右值** 实际上不是 **值** 的属性，而是表达式的属性。

<!-- Every expression in C++ has two properties: a type (which is used for type checking), and a value category (which is used for certain kinds of syntax checking, such as whether the result of the expression can be assigned to). In C++03 and earlier, l-values and r-values were the only two value categories available. -->

C++中的每个表达式都有两个属性：一个类型（用于类型检查）和一个值类别（用于某些类型的语法检查，例如表达式的结果是否可以分配）。在C++ 03和更早的时候，左值和右值是仅有的两个可用的值类别。

<!-- The actual definition of which expressions are l-values and which are r-values is surprisingly complicated, so we’ll take a simplified view of the subject that will largely suffice for our purposes. -->

对于哪些表达式是左值，哪些是右值的实际定义非常复杂，因此我们将对这个主题采取简化的观点，这在很大程度上满足了我们的目的。

<!-- It’s simplest to think of an l-value (also called a locator value) as a function or an object (or an expression that evaluates to a function or object). All l-values have assigned memory addresses. -->

简单点可以认为左值（也称为定位器值[locator value]）是函数或对象（或计算为函数或对象的表达式）所有左值都分配了内存地址。

<!-- When l-values were originally defined, they were defined as “values that are suitable to be on the left-hand side of an assignment expression”. However, later, the const keyword was added to the language, and l-values were split into two sub-categories: modifiable l-values, which can be changed, and non-modifiable l-values, which are const. -->

当左值最初被定义时，它们被定义为“适合位于赋值表达式左侧的值”。然而，后来，const关键字被添加到语言中，并且左值被分为两个子类：可修改的左值（可以更改）和不可修改的左值（const）。

It’s simplest to think of an r-value as “everything that is not an l-value”. This notably includes literals (e.g. 5), temporary values (e.g. x+1), and anonymous objects (e.g. Fraction(5, 2)). r-values are typically evaluated for their values, have expression scope (they die at the end of the expression they are in), and cannot be assigned to. This non-assignment rule makes sense, because assigning a value applies a side-effect to the object. Since r-values have expression scope, if we were to assign a value to an r-value, then the r-value would either go out of scope before we had a chance to use the assigned value in the next expression (which makes the assignment useless) or we’d have to use a variable with a side effect applied more than once in an expression (which by now you should know causes undefined behavior!).

最简单的方法是把右值看作“不是l值的所有东西”。这特别包括字面值（例如 `5` ）、临时值（例如 `x+1` ）和匿名对象（例如 `Fraction(5, 2)`）。右值通常是针对其值进行求值的，具有表达式范围（它们在其所在表达式的结尾处消亡），并且不能被赋值。这个非赋值规则是有意义的，因为赋值会给对象带来副作用。因为右值有表达式范围，如果我们要给右值赋值，那么右值会在我们有机会在下一个表达式中使用上次赋值之前就超出了范围（这使得赋值毫无用处），要么我们必须使用一个变量，在一个表达式中多次应用一个副作用（现在您应该知道这会导致未定义的行为！）。

In order to support move semantics, C++11 introduces 3 new value categories: pr-values, x-values, and gl-values. We will largely ignore these since understanding them isn’t necessary to learn about or use move semantics effectively. If you’re interested, cppreference.com has an extensive list of expressions that qualify for each of the various value categories, as well as more detail about them.

L-value references

Prior to C++11, only one type of reference existed in C++, and so it was just called a “reference”. However, in C++11, it’s sometimes called an l-value reference. L-value references can only be initialized with modifiable l-values.

|L-value reference  |Can be initialized with | Can modify|
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
|Modifiable l-values | Yes  |Yes|
|Non-modifiable l-values | No  |No|
|R-values | No  |No|

L-value references to const objects can be initialized with l-values and r-values alike. However, those values can’t be modified.

|L-value reference to const | Can be initialized with | Can modify|
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
|Modifiable l-values  |Yes  |No|
|Non-modifiable l-values  |Yes  |No|
|R-values  |Yes  |No|

L-value references to const objects are particularly useful because they allow us to pass any type of argument (l-value or r-value) into a function without making a copy of the argument.

R-value references

C++11 adds a new type of reference called an r-value reference. An r-value reference is a reference that is designed to be initialized with an r-value (only). While an l-value reference is created using a single ampersand, an r-value reference is created using a double ampersand:

```cpp

int x{ 5 };
int &lref{ x }; // l-value reference initialized with l-value x
int &&rref{ 5 }; // r-value reference initialized with r-value 5
```

|R-value reference  |Can be initialized with | Can modify |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
Modifiable l-values  |No  |No
Non-modifiable l-values  |No  |No
R-values  |Yes  |Yes

|R-value reference to const  |Can be initialized with | Can modify|
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
|Modifiable l-values | No | No|
|Non-modifiable l-values | No | No|
|R-values | Yes | No|

R-value references have two properties that are useful. First, r-value references extend the lifespan of the object they are initialized with to the lifespan of the r-value reference (l-value references to const objects can do this too). Second, non-const r-value references allow you to modify the r-value!

Let’s take a look at some examples:

```cpp

# include <iostream>

class Fraction
{
private:
 int m_numerator;
 int m_denominator;

public:
 Fraction(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1) :
  m_numerator{ numerator }, m_denominator{ denominator }
 {
 }

 friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction &f1)
 {
  out << f1.m_numerator << '/' << f1.m_denominator;
  return out;
 }
};

int main()
{
 auto &&rref{ Fraction{ 3, 5 } }; // r-value reference to temporary Fraction

    // f1 of operator<< binds to the temporary, no copies are created.
    std::cout << rref << '\n';

 return 0;
} // rref (and the temporary Fraction) goes out of scope here

```

This program prints:

3/5

As an anonymous object, Fraction(3, 5) would normally go out of scope at the end of the expression in which it is defined. However, since we’re initializing an r-value reference with it, its duration is extended until the end of the block. We can then use that r-value reference to print the Fraction’s value.

Now let’s take a look at a less intuitive example:

```cpp
# include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int &&rref{ 5 }; // because we're initializing an r-value reference with a literal, a temporary with value 5 is created here
    rref = 10;
    std::cout << rref << '\n';

    return 0;
}

```

This program prints:

10

While it may seem weird to initialize an r-value reference with a literal value and then be able to change that value, when initializing an r-value with a literal, a temporary is constructed from the literal so that the reference is referencing a temporary object, not a literal value.

R-value references are not very often used in either of the manners illustrated above.

R-value references as function parameters

R-value references are more often used as function parameters. This is most useful for function overloads when you want to have different behavior for l-value and r-value arguments.

```cpp

void fun(const int &lref) // l-value arguments will select this function
{
 std::cout << "l-value reference to const\n";
}

void fun(int &&rref) // r-value arguments will select this function
{
 std::cout << "r-value reference\n";
}

int main()
{
 int x{ 5 };
 fun(x); // l-value argument calls l-value version of function
 fun(5); // r-value argument calls r-value version of function

 return 0;
}

```

This prints:

l-value reference to const
r-value reference

As you can see, when passed an l-value, the overloaded function resolved to the version with the l-value reference. When passed an r-value, the overloaded function resolved to the version with the r-value reference (this is considered a better match than a l-value reference to const).

Why would you ever want to do this? We’ll discuss this in more detail in the next lesson. Needless to say, it’s an important part of move semantics.

One interesting note:

```cpp

 int &&ref{ 5 };
 fun(ref);
```

actually calls the l-value version of the function! Although variable ref has type r-value reference to an integer, it is actually an l-value itself (as are all named variables). The confusion stems from the use of the term r-value in two different contexts. Think of it this way: Named-objects are l-values. Anonymous objects are r-values. The type of the named object or anonymous object is independent from whether it’s an l-value or r-value. Or, put another way, if r-value reference had been called anything else, this confusion wouldn’t exist.

Returning an r-value reference

You should almost never return an r-value reference, for the same reason you should almost never return an l-value reference. In most cases, you’ll end up returning a hanging reference when the referenced object goes out of scope at the end of the function.

Quiz time

1) State which of the following lettered statements will not compile:

```cpp
int main()
{
 int x{};

 // l-value references
 int &ref1{ x }; // A
 int &ref2{ 5 }; // B

 const int &ref3{ x }; // C
 const int &ref4{ 5 }; // D

 // r-value references
 int &&ref5{ x }; // E
 int &&ref6{ 5 }; // F

 const int &&ref7{ x }; // G
 const int &&ref8{ 5 }; // H

 return 0;
}
```

Hide Solution
B, E, and G won’t compile.
